# Fancy-Tic-Tac-Toe-Refined

## About:  
A simple Tic Tac Toe game made in Unity.  

Alpha 1.0, the first playable version of the game, was developed in only a few hours, it's code is still at an extremelly "non-optimal" format, but works perfectly, and that's what matters for now.  

## Plan for Future Updates:  
- Implement the use of 'arrays' for the gameplay logic.    
- Add an option to play against an AI with at least 2 difficulty levels.  
- Add other game modes (at least one more).  
- Add game sounds with an option to adjust volume.  
- Add an option to switch between 'fullscreen windowed' and 'windowed' mode (alternatively, you can press ALT + Enter to switch between the modes).  
- Add an option to switch between 'default' and 'dark' mode colors.  
- Allow users to upload their own background image.  
- Allow users to play with keyboard only (or controller (maybe)).  
- MAYBE add a mode to play online with someone via Hamachi / Radmin / Port Forwarding (alternatively, you could use something like 'Parsec' to play online for now, I think).  

## Controls:  
- Left Mouse Click (Mouse 1) - For Everything
